## SSH Configuration on Cisco Device

To enable and properly configure the SSH service on your network device, follow these steps:

1. **Connect to Your Device via Console or Telnet:**

   Connect to your device using a console cable or Telnet.

2. **Enable and Configure the SSH Service:**

   Use the following commands to enable and configure the SSH service:

   ```bash
   enable
   configure terminal
   hostname Router
   ip domain-name example.com
   crypto key generate rsa
   ip ssh version 2
   line vty 0 15
   transport input ssh
   login local
   exit
   ```

3. **Create a User Account:**
